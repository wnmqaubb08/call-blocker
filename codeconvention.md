# Introduction #

Code conventions are important to programmers for a number of reasons:
• 80% of the lifetime cost of a piece of software goes to maintenance.
• Hardly any software is maintained for its whole life by the original author.
• Code conventions improve the readability of the software, allowing engineers to
understand new code more quickly and thoroughly.
• If you ship your source code as a product, you need to make sure it is as well packaged
and clean as any other product you create.
